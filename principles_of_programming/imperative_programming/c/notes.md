# Introduction To Programming: C Course Notes


### C Specific Language Features
- Follows the **procedural** paradigm (imperative programming) where code is structured as a collection of procedures where any given procedures may be called at any point during a program's execution.
- Strings (char *str;) are NOT assignable. To modify a string variable, their values have to be copied to a separate variable using `strcpy()`.
- The `->` operator is an abstraction for a pointer to a variable in a struct e.g., `node->int = 1;` == `*(node).int = 1;`.
- ALL arguments passed into functions are copied by value, unless memory address is passed as a pointer pre-pended to an argument or the data type of the argument is an `array` or a `string`.
- Use `fread()` to continuously read a pre-determined chunk of memory from a file, use `fgets()` to read a file line by line.
- Idiomatic C code is rigorous in checking types, return values and handles all potential errors.

**Data Types and Assignability**


| Data Type  | Assignable? |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `Char`     | `Yes`       |
| `Short`    | `Yes`       |
| `Int`      | `Yes`       |
| `Long`     | `Yes`       |
| `Float`    | `Yes`       |
| `Double`   | `Yes`       |
| `Pointer`  | `Yes`       |
| `Array`    | `No`        |
| `Function` | `No`        |

*Arrays and functions can be assigned to pointers, which are themselves assignable*

*Note that the const keyword can be used to make any data type immutable, but it is not a data type itself. Additionally, while arrays are technically mutable in C, their size cannot be changed once they are declared, so they are considered immutable for practical purposes.*

### Python Specific Language Features
- Implements the object-oriented programming paradigm (imperative programming) - enables types (classes) to encapsulate data and the functions that can read and modify that data.
- Python manages memory automatically - allocation and freeing. You cannot allocate memory dynamically on the heap. 
- Idiomatic python code takes is lackadaisical and not as rigorous as C. `try`, `catch` and `except` are used to handle problems as they happen without the rigorous safety of C.

### The Problem Solving Method
1. Identify the core algorithm. e.g., ignoring all else, what do I need to do to each character in a string or how do I need to transform x into y.
2. Write down and populate data structures on paper.
3. Write down pseudo-code that solves most cases.
4. Look at edge cases and add guards.
5. Code the algorithm.

## Week 1 - Lecture 1 - C

### General Knowledge
- `Machine code` - technical term to refer to binary digits. Contrasts with `source code` that humans write.
- `Side effects` are consequences of function calls that can be unintended or desired. E.g., Printing to `stdout` is an example of a desired side effect, If functions have side effects of modifying state variables, the program's outcome depends on the history (order of evaluation) of these variables making understanding and debugging harder.
- Escape sequence `\n` tells the compiler to print a blank line.
- Preprocessor directives such as `#include <stdio.h>;` are used to declare which libraries the program needs.
    - back in the day, resources were limited and so only the required libraries and components were imported to reduce bloat.
- `%%` - will print one percent sign, e.g., `printf("I got %i%% in my test, 99);"`
- `%s`, `%d` etc are `format specifiers / format codes`, they are placeholders for variables that can be passed in as arguments to `printf()` and are type dependant e.g., `%s` for `string`, `%d` for `double` etc. See https://www.tutorialspoint.com/format-specifiers-in-c.
- The compiler analyses and the program from top to bottom, left to right.
- Constants guard against erroneously changing a variable e.g., `const int a = 2;`.
- `Do / while` loops allow you to run logic until the condition in the while statement evaluates to false. E.g., running do until user enters a valid input. These should be read as Do x until y is true e.g., Take input until input is invalid.
- The `main` function and custom data types defined using `typedef` are normally declared at top of the file for better readability.

#### Loops
- For loops are used to repeat logic until a given condition evaluates to false - similar to `while` loop logic. They can also be used to repeat logic n number of times.
- Both `for` and `while` loops have exactly the same functionality, but differ in their syntax.

#### Integer Overflow & Underflow
- Signed `int`s (+ || -) can store values between 2 billionÂ and. -2 billion on a 32 bit machine.
- Unsigned `int`s can store values of around 4 billion (4294967295). Unsigned ints can only store positive values as they do not have a prefix sign bit.
- Integers are vulnerable to overflow if the correct data type is not used for the stored value. E.g., storing too large of a value in a 32 bit signed `int`.
- The first bit (most significant bit) denotes whether integer is positive / negative.
- Underflow - storing a value lesser than the minimum allowed value. This happens when the minimum value that a signed int can hold i.e., -2,147,483,648 has been decremented. 

#### Y2K / Year 2038 Problem
- Y2K - old programs customarily only used the last 2 digits to represent the year property to conserve memory. E.g., 1999 = 99. In case of 2000, last 2 digits would result in 00 as the year property, causing incorrect data to be stored. Effects mitigated by raising awareness.
- Unix time stores seconds since 1 jan 1970. **signed** 32 bit integers can store values up to 4 billion, this will be reached on 19th Jan 2038 as 4b seconds would have passed.
- There are no universal solutions to these problems, developers must update their own systems. Embedded systems and rarely-updated software are the most vulnerable.

## Week 2 - Lecture 2 - Arrays

### General Knowledge
- An array is specifically a contiguous block of memory who's size be defined at compile time either in the declaration or through a constant.
- Ciphertext is just plaintext that has been encrypted through an algorithm.
- `gcc` and `clang` are different compilers used to convert source code to machine code.
- Running `clang <filename>.c` will output and `a.out` file e.g., `clang hello.c` -> `a.out`. 
- Command line arguments / flags modify the behaviours of a command
- A more succinct command is `clang -o hello hello.c`
- `a.out` is the conventional output file for assembler output.
- Clang links libraries that do not ship with the C standard library, e.g., cs50 -> `clang -o hello hello.c -l cs50`

#### Compilation Process
- The compilation process consists of: **pre-processing, compiling, assembling and linking (PCAL).**
- **Pre-processing** - resolves all of the pre-processor directives e.g., `#include <stdio.h>` - basically copies and pastes all the libraries included as headers in the main file.
- **Compiling** - convert C code to assembly code. This contains instructions that the CPU understands.
- **Linking** - link all the code that was referenced by pre-processor directives (libraries that were imported by the main file).

De-compiling is the process of converting machine code to source code. Compilers don't remember function or variable names - this makes it harder to reverse engineer it.

### Debugging
- Involves stopping the execution of a program at a set point in the code using a breakpoint, then using the tools continue, step into, step out and step over to find mistakes in the code.

**Process**
- Use a `printf()` statement to check state of the program.
- Breakpoints allow you to slow execution to step through the program line by line.
- The CALL STACK shows the currently running function (top-most) and which functions will run once the current one exits.
- `Continue` -> Resumes program execution after it had been stopped by the debugger until the next breakpoint is encountered.
- `step over` -> Run the line of code currently highlighted by the debugger. Useful when you are confident the line will work. E.g., a method is about to be invoked, but you're not interested in debugging this particular invocation, so you want the debugger to execute that method completely as one entire step.
- `step into` -> Inspect the line of code currently highlighted by the debugger. Useful when you need to investigate further. E.g., a method is about to be invoked, and you want to debug into the code of that method, so the next step is to go into that method and continue debugging step-by-step.
- `step out` -> Runs the current function to completion and return to the line of code that had called that function. E.g., the debugger is inside of a function and the user does not want to step through every line of the function. 

### Data Types
Each data type has a specific number of bits assigned to it by the machine. 8 bits is 1 byte. Modern 64 bit machines have integers and memory addresses that are 8 bytes wide.

| Data Type     | Memory Requirement |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| `bool`        | 1 byte             |
| `int`         | 4 bytes            |
| `long`        | 8 bytes            |
| `float`       | 4 bytes            |
| `double`      | 8 bytes            |
| `char`        | 4 bytes            |
| `* (pointer)` | 8 bytes            |

### Arrays
- An array is a linear data structure used to store data contiguously in memory (data is stored next to each other).
- An array implements the list concrete data type.
- In C, an array must be declared with a certain memory size at compile time. e.g, `3 bytes`.

**2D Arrays**
- Contain arrays inside of an array.
- Useful data structure to group data that can also be iterated on.
- Requires nested for loops for iteration.

```
// declaration and initializing 1D array
int scores[3] = {1,2,3};

// initializing through indexing
int nums[2];

nums[0] = 1;
nums[1] = 2;
```

- The `string` data type is implemented like an array - a contiguous block of characters. Memory taken in bytes can be calculated by `(length * size_of_data_type) + 1 byte` - one extra byte for the null character `\0`

**ASCII Encoding**
- A character encoding standard for standardizing communication between systems.
- Individual characters are mapped to integers. Means their corresponding integer value can be printed.
- 0 maps to NUL.
- Chart: https://cs.smu.ca/~porter/csc/ref/asciifull.gif
- *ASCII is case sensitive*

**Memory**
- A system used to temporarily store data and instructions on how to manipulate that data. Is accessed by the CPU during the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
- Contains a finite number of bytes. Has addresses where data is stored.

**Floating Point Imprecision**
The finite number of numbers that can be stored in the float data type (4 bytes) causes floating point imprecision.

**Command Line Arguments**
- Users can provide arguments whilst running the program through the terminal. The program can use these values at runtime as part of the program logic.
- To support command line arguments, the main method must accept an array of string arguments: `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`. The main function can also block arguments by being initialized with the `void` data type.
- `argc` counts the number of args supplied when the program was invoked. ` char *argv[]` is an array of the supplied arguments.

**Program Exit Codes**
- User defined integers that map to error messages.
- Each error code corresponds to a type of error that has happened. E.g., HTTP Error Codes (400, 404, 500...).
- 0 conventionally signals the success case. If a failure occurs, explicitly catch and return error messages e.g., `return 3;`

**Program Input**
- `fgets()` is conventionally used to accept strings as a CLI argument. Using `scanf()` suffices for characters, however fails after it encounters first space or empty character.
e.g.,
```
char buf[1024];
if (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin) != NULL) {
  // Check that the input is not too long
  if (buf[strlen(buf) - 1] != '\n') {
    // Handle input that is too long
  } else {
    // Use the input string
  }
} else {
  // Handle error
}
```

**Structs**
- Custom data types that encapsulate some values.
- Should be declared at top of file to allow all functions to access it.
- Supports dot notation to access encapsulated properties and attributes.
- Does not support default values as it is just a type definition and these do not accept values, only data types..

e.g.,
```
typedef struct
{
    char *name;
    char *phone_number;
}
person;
```

- In computer science, encapsulation is the idea that related data is grouped together, and here weâve encapsulated two pieces of information, `name` and `phone_number` into the same data structure. The color of a pixel, with red, green, and blue values, might also be well-represented by a data structure as well.

## Week 3 - Lecture 3 - Algorithms

**Algorithm Types**
- A **greedy algorithm** is one âthat always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the overall, or globally, optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.â


**Toy Algorithm Example: Checking for duplicates in a string using double for-loops.**
- First for loop (i) iterates over each character in the string.
- Nested for loop (j) iterates over each character in the string for each Ith character. Nesting allows for comparison.
- Nested for loop (j) terminates before length of the string `strlen(key) - 1` to avoid out of bounds error.
- Nested for loop (j) is initialized with i's value to prevent redundantly comparing digits before i.
- Comparison occurs between i and j + 1 to compare `key[i]` to the next value in the string.

```
for (int i = 0; i < strlen(key); i++)
{
    for (int j = i; j < strlen(key) - 1; j++)
    {
        printf("checking %c with %c\n", key[i], key[j + 1]);
    }
}
```

**Big O**
Refers to the asymptotic runtime complexity of an algorithm. Signifies how the runtime complexity changes as the size of n reaches infinity.
- `O(n)` is said as "order of n steps"

**Runtimes by speed (slowest / most inefficient first)**

| Complexity   | Explanation                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `O(n!)`      | Most inefficient. May never reach the end of the data sequence.                                                       |
| `O(n^2)`     | Highly inefficient. The average complexity of naive sorting algorithms (bubble-sort, insertion-sort, selection-sort). |
| `O(n log n)` | Average runtime of efficient sorting algorithms e.g., merge-sort.                                                     |
| `O(n)`       | Runtime grows linearly with the value with n. Average runtime of naive searching algorithms e.g., linear search.      |
| `O(log n)`   | Average runtime of efficient searching algorithms e.g., binary-search.                                                |
| `O(1)`       | Represents constant time (a finite number of steps for any input size)                                                |

**Dominant Term** - the term in the algorithm that experiences the most growth.

**Best / Worst / Average Cases** - the bounds for an algorithm.

**Best Case** is defined using the Î© symbol. The best case for linear search is Î©(1) or the first element checked. Best case for binary search is also Î©(1) or the first middle element that is checked.
- An algorithm with running time of `O(1)` means that a constant number of steps is required, no matter how big the problem is.

**Î** theta symbol signifies the *same* upper / lower bounds for an algorithm. E.g., Selection Sort has a best and worst case runtime complexity of Î(n^2) because even if it is passed a sorted list, it needs to search the list for the smallest element, each time to verify.

**Run-time Complexity Calculation**
```
Total number of steps * number of steps or comparisons at each iteration;
```

**Asymptotically** - As `n` approaches infinity / "gets really large".

### Searching Algorithms

### 1. Linear Search
#### Description
Searching each individual value at a time. Analogous to searching a phone book one page at a time from the first page.

#### Implementation
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int nums[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int target = 3;

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    {
        if (nums[i] == target)
        {
            printf("%i was found on index %i\n", target, i);
            return 0;
        }
    }

    printf("Not found");
    return 1;
}
```

### 2. Binary Search
#### Description
Searching a pre-sorted array whilst reducing the problem space by half. **Requires the array to be pre-sorted**. Analogous to searching a phone book by starting in the middle then discarding one half each time.

#### Implementation
```
#include <stdio.h>

int binarySearch(int array[], int x, int low, int high) {
  if (high >= low) {
    int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

    // If found at mid, then return it
    if (array[mid] == x)
      return mid;

    // Search the left half
    if (array[mid] > x)
      return binarySearch(array, x, low, mid - 1);

    // Search the right half
    return binarySearch(array, x, mid + 1, high);
  }

  return -1;
}

int main(void) {
  int array[] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
  int n = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);
  int x = 4;
  int result = binarySearch(array, x, 0, n - 1);
  if (result == -1)
    printf("Not found");
  else
    printf("Element is found at index %d", result);
}
```

#### Implementation Trick
- Keep throwing away half the array until the start > end (they don't cross).


### Sorting Algorithms
- Consider whether sorting is worth it if only going to search once as linear search may be more efficient than first sorting then searching.

| Algorithm      | Best        | Average     | Worst        | Worst (Space) |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Selection Sort | Î©(n^2)      | Î¸(n^2)      | O(n^2)       | O(1)          |
| Bubble Sort    | Î©(n)        | Î¸(n^2)      | O(n^2)       | O(1)          |
| Insertion Sort | Î©(n)        | Î¸(n^2)      | O(n^2)       | O(1)          |
| Heap Sort      | Î©(n log(n)) | Î¸(n log(n)) | O(n log(n))  | O(1)          |
| Quick Sort     | Î©(n log(n)) | Î¸(n log(n)) | O(n^2)       | O(n)          |
| Merge Sort     | Î©(n log(n)) | Î¸(n log(n)) | O(n log(n))  | O(n)          |
| Bucket Sort    | Î©(n +k)     | Î¸(n +k)     | O(n^2)       | O(n)          |
| Radix Sort     | Î©(nk)       | Î¸(nk)       | O(nk)        | O(n + k)      |
| Count Sort     | Î©(n +k)     | Î¸(n +k)     | O(n +k)      | O(k)          |
| Shell Sort     | Î©(n log(n)) | Î¸(n log(n)) | O(n^2)       | O(1)          |
| Tim Sort       | Î©(n)        | Î¸(n log(n)) | O(n log (n)) | O(n)          |
| Tree Sort      | Î©(n log(n)) | Î¸(n log(n)) | O(n^2)       | O(n)          |
| Cube Sort      | Î©(n)        | Î¸(n log(n)) | O(n log(n))  | O(n)          |

### 1. Selection Sort
#### Description
- Iterate across each element in an array. Find the smallest value, then swap it with the element current accessed.
- Both `i` and `j` nested for loops should run until the length of the array
- Declare `current_min` and `min_position` inside the `i` for loop. Allows you to change the Ith element with the value of j.
- Initialize `current_min` with the current Ith value e.g., `int current_min = nums[i]`.

#### Implementation
```
#include <stdio.h>

int selection_sort(int nums[], int arr_len);

const int NUMS_LENGTH = 8;

/*
- C implementation of the selection sort algorithm.
*/
int main(void)
{
    int nums[NUMS_LENGTH] = {10, 11, 90, 21, 29, 2, 1, 0};

    selection_sort(nums, NUMS_LENGTH);

    return 0;
}

int selection_sort(int nums[], int arr_len)
{
    // selection sort;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr_len; i++)
    {
        int current_min = nums[i];
        int min_position = i;
        // find minimum value
        for (int j = i; j < arr_len; j++)
        {
            if (nums[j] < current_min)
            {
                current_min = nums[j];
                min_position = j;
            }
        }
        // swap current position's value with the minimum value
        int holder = nums[min_position];
        nums[min_position] = nums[i];
        nums[i] = current_min;
        printf("%i ", nums[i]);
    }

    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

#### Performance
`O(n^2)` best case, `O(n^2)` worst case as for each element, algorithm will have to find the smallest element, regardless if the array is sorted or not.
Can be represented as Î©(n^2).

#### Implementation Trick
- the i `for` loop is initialized at 0 and terminates at n.
- the h `for` loop is initialized at i and terminates at n. i.e., `for (int j = i ...`
- initialize a `minimum` variable inside the i `for` loop to keep track of the min value during each pass.
- Initialize a `min_position` variable inside the i `for` loop to keep track of the min value's position during each pass.

### 2. Bubble Sort
#### Description
- Iterate across each element in an array whilst swapping the position of a larger element with a smaller one until it bubbles to the end.
- `i` for loop should run until the length of the array. `j` nested for loop should run to the length of the array - 1. This avoids a segfault.
- Compare `nums[j]` with `nums[j + 1]` and swap if `nums[j] > nums[j + 1]`.

#### Implementation
```
#include <stdio.h>

int bubble_sort(int nums[], int arr_len);

const int NUMS_LENGTH = 7;

int main(void)
{
    int nums[NUMS_LENGTH] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}; //{20, 8, 5, 30, 9, 4, 1};

    bubble_sort(nums, NUMS_LENGTH);

    return 0;
}

int bubble_sort(int nums[], int arr_len)
{
    int is_swapped = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr_len; i++)
    {
        // terminates at 1 position before the end to avoid comparing last element with one out of the array
        // ..preventing a segfault.
        for (int j = 0; j < arr_len - 1; j++)
        {
            if (nums[j] > nums[j + 1])
            {
                // swap
                int holder = nums[j];
                nums[j] = nums[j + 1];
                nums[j + 1] = holder;
                is_swapped = 1;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < arr_len; i++)
        {
            printf("%i ", nums[i]);
        }

        printf("\n");

        // optimization
        if (is_swapped == 0)
        {
            printf("Array sorted. no swaps made.\n");
            return 0;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Performance
`O(n^2)` worst case, as the algorithm will have to swap n -1 elements n - 1 times. `O(n)` best case if optimization of `is_swapped` flag. Program will terminate after only one pass as no swaps has been made.

#### Optimization
- Since Bubble Sort makes n-1 comparisons, n-1 times, if an array is pre-sorted, using an `is_sorted` flag to exit early prevents n-1 iterations. This changes the lower bound from `O(n^2)` to `O(n)`

#### Implementation Trick
- 2nd j `for` loop should terminate at n-1.
- Swaps only need to happen for elements being accessed by the j `for` loop.
- Use a `holder` integer variable to swap the nums.

### Recursion
- Recursion is calling a function within itself on a smaller and smaller problem space.
- The functions keep getting pushed to the call stack until the base case is triggered, then they are run one by one from last added to first and are popped off the stack in this order.

#### A recursive implementation always has two parts:
#### Base case
Which is the simplest, smallest instance of the problem, that canât be decomposed any further. Base cases often correspond to **emptiness** â the empty string, the empty list, the empty set, the empty tree, zero, etc.

#### Recursive step
Decomposes a larger instance of the problem into one or more simpler or smaller instances that can be solved by recursive calls, and then **recombines** the results of those sub-problems to produce the solution to the original problem.

#### Itâs important for the recursive step to transform the problem instance into something smaller, otherwise the recursion may never end. If every recursive step shrinks the problem, and the base case lies at the bottom, then the recursion is guaranteed to be finite.

#### A recursive implementation may have more than one base case, or more than one recursive step. For example, the Fibonacci function has two base cases, n=0 and n=1.


5 5tep process to solve any recursive problem
1. Determine simplest input for the function (Base case) - the case where an explicit answer is provided.
2. Draw example inputs and outputs to visualize the problem.
3. Relate hard cases to smaller and simpler cases. "If given answer for n(m - 1) case, can I solve for n(m)"
4. Generalize pattern into an expression.
5. Write code by combining the pattern with the base case.

*Recursive Leap of Faith*
Assume that simpler cases work out and can be extrapolated for more complex cases.

#### Examples
```
#include <stdio.h>

int collatz(int n);

int main(void)
{
    printf("%i\n", collatz(1));

    return 0;
}

int collatz(int n)
{
    // base case
    if (n == 1)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    else if (n % 2 == 0)
    {
        return 1 + collatz(n / 2);
    }
    else {
        return 1 + collatz(3 * n + 1);
    }
}
```

## Week 4 - Lecture 4 - Memory
### General Knowledge
- Strings are implemented similarly to arrays in a contiguous block of memory.
- In C, double quotes automatically insert the `\0` character at the end of a string.
- Any values that are not initialized explicitly will be initialized with garbage values.
- Passing any variables into a function gives it local copies and not the actual variables in memory - this is "pass by value". To use the underlying memory, a function needs the memory address, then use dereferencing to modify the underlying value.

### Garbage Values
- Values left in memory once a program has finished running.
- Uninitialized variables have garbage values.
- When a program allocates memory and then subsequently deallocates it, the memory is not necessarily erased the data that was previously stored in it. Instead, the memory is simply marked as available for reuse by the operating system. This means that the data that was previously stored in the memory is still present, at least until the operating system reuses the memory and overwrites the data with new information. If a program subsequently allocates the same memory again and accesses the data that was previously stored in it, it is possible that the program could retrieve sensitive information that was not properly erased or overwritten. This could happen, for example, if the program is not designed to properly initialize or erase the memory before using it. To prevent sensitive information from being accessed in this way, it is important to properly erase or overwrite the data in memory when it is no longer needed, and to allocate and initialize memory correctly when it is needed. This can help to ensure that sensitive information is not inadvertently accessed by other programs or processes.

### Hexadecimal
- Hexadecimal notation makes it easy to read large numbers - helpful in the case of reading memory addresses or bytes.
- A color e.g., `FFFFFF` can signify the proportion of `RGB` values, in this case R: 255, G:255, B: 255.
- a.k.a base 16.
- Only has a 16^1 and 16^0 places. This way values from 0 to 255 can be represented.
- 1 hex digit is stored using 4 bits.
- Memory addresses are usually denoted using the hexadecimal system. These are denoted using the `0x` prefix. 

### Memory & Pointers
- **A pointer is just an address in memory.**
- Each "cell" in the abstract memory grid has an address e.g., `0x1001c4f9f` the `0x` prefix denotes that a number is a memory address.
- The `&` operator refers to an address in memory e.g., `0x1001c4f9a`.
- A pointer simply points to an address in memory. Is declared using the `*` operator and has a type e.g., `int *p;` creates an integer pointer. The `*` operator does the opposite of `&`, it looks inside the memory.
- The syntax `int *p` is read as integer pointer p.
- A pointer can store the value of an address in memory by "pointing" to it. E.g., `int *p = &n;`.
- A pointer data type needs to support the largest value supported by the CPU, hence it is `8 bytes`.
- Used the 'mail box' analogy that contained the address of a variable. Then used the address in the program.
- When defining string such as `char *s = "abc";`, `s` is a pointer to the first character in memory. Just need to know the first memory address as you can keep going until the null character `\0` is found.
- The `*` is used for both creating a pointer variable as well as dereferencing a pointer.

### Dereferencing Pointers
- Using the `*` operator on a pointer (i.e., a memory address) returns it's contents. E.g.,
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 10;
    
    // a pointer variables stores the memory address of some other variable. '&' syntax means memory address.
    int *ptr = &n;

    // %p is the format code to print an address with printf. And we only need to use the name of the variable, p, after weâve declared it.
    printf("%p\n", &n);

    printf("%p\n", ptr);

    // dereference (reading and modifying value at particular memory address)
    printf("initial: %i\n", *ptr);

}
```

### Custom data types
- syntax `typedef <PRIMITIVE> <TYPE_NAME>` maps a primitive to a more readable custom type. This is also how structs are defines.

**Array Indexing Syntactic Sugar**
- As an array is a contiguous chunk of memory, if it's starting address in memory and the number of elements are known, a `for` loop can be used to print the values present in the array.
- Array / string indexing is usually carried out by the square bracket syntax. This is just syntactic sugar for using pointers to iterate on the underlying elements.
e.g.,
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = "HI!";
    printf("%p\n", s);
    printf("%p\n", &s[0]);
    printf("%p\n", &s[1]);
    printf("%p\n", &s[2]);
    printf("%p\n", &s[3]);
}
```

### Strings
- Declaring a string by using `char *str = "abc";` returns the memory address of the first character of the string. The data in the first character can be accessed through dereferencing such as `printf("%c\n", *str);`.

### Valgrind
- Detects memory leaks.
- Memory leaks are particularly bad for long-running programs as less space becomes available for other programs to run.
- Leaks are avoided by freeing variables created through `malloc()` by using the `free()` function in `stdlib.h`.

### Heap / Stack
- Memory is divided up into 1. machine code, 2. global variables, 3. heap, 4. stack.
- **Heap** is user allocated memory e.g., through `malloc();`. Is prone to **heap overflow** - when the program writes more memory on the heap that is allocated for the heap - the program can then write beyond the bounds of the heap memory.
- **Stack** stores static function variables and arguments. Is prone to **stack overflow** - functions taking up too much memory and not returning.
- Recursion can cause a **stack overflow** as each recursive step adds an additional stack frame with it's own variables and arguments. In case of iteration, only one stack frame is required. Recursion may not always consume more stack space than iteration - depends on implementation of the programming language and the underlying compiler.

### Null pointer exception
- An error that occurs when a program attempts to dereference a null pointer. This can happen if the program tries to access memory that has not been allocated, or if it tries to follow a pointer that has not been initialized.


## Files
- File formats are denoted by their extension e.g., `.wav`, `.jpeg` etc. File formats define the structure of the file. E.g., .wav file format means that every .wav file will have a 44 byte header such as
```
typedef uint8_t   BYTE;
typedef uint16_t  WORD;
typedef uint32_t  DWORD;

typedef struct
{
    BYTE   chunkID[4];
    DWORD  chunkSize;
    BYTE   format[4];
    BYTE   subchunk1ID[4];
    DWORD  subchunk1Size;
    WORD   audioFormat;
    WORD   numChannels;
    DWORD  sampleRate;
    DWORD  byteRate;
    WORD   blockAlign;
    WORD   bitsPerSample;
    BYTE   subchunk2ID[4];
    DWORD  subchunk2Size;
} __attribute__((__packed__))
WAVHEADER;
```

- Headers define metadata - data about the data that begins immediately after the header ends. The header contains all the information for manipulating the file.

- A file then contains n number of blocks that store the actual file data. These are read into memory one at a time.

### File operations
1. Each file must be opened using `fopen()` e.g.,
```
FILE *inptr = fopen(file_name, "r");
if (inptr == NULL)
{
    fclose(inptr);
    printf("err: could not open file");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
```

*inptr refers to the address that is currently being read. This can be manipulated with `fseek()` if the *inptr needs to be manually controlled.


2. The header of a file is at the start. If the header's data structure and types are known, it can be read into memory using `fread()` e.g.,
```
WAVHEADER wav_header;
fread(&wav_header, sizeof(WAVHEADER), 1, inptr);
```
Because `*inptr`'s value is still the start of the file, fread() will read the next x bytes where the header data is. **Once the header has been read into memory, *inptr will advance to the xth byte where the header ends and the file data starts**. Can use a loop to iterate over the next n *blocks* of file content.

2. To read file content blocks, memory needs to be allocated for each block. Note that blocks are usually read one at a time unless a separate data structure exists that is simultaneously storing blocks for comparison etc.
```
int BLOCK_SIZE = 512;

BYTE buffer[BLOCK_SIZE];

// Read 512 blocks into buffer until reaching end of card
while (fread(buffer, 1, BLOCK_SIZE, inptr) == BLOCK_SIZE)
{
    // do something with each block
}
```

3. All file pointers need to be closed once data has been written to a file or at the end of the program. This allows the OS to release the memory for holding the file. E.g.,
```
fclose(outptr);
fclose(inptr);
```

## Week 5 - Lecture 5 - Data Structures
### General Knowledge
- Arrays are contiguous, meaning data is stored next to each other in memory. Becomes painful very quickly when adding extra items to the array - overconsumption of memory, more code etc... Memory may not have enough space to completely copy new values.
- Linked lists are discontiguous meaning data is not stored next to each other. One node contains the data and a pointer to the next item. The end node points to NULL signifying the end of a list.\
- `NULL` refers to `Ox0` - the convention for a NULL character pointer in memory.


### Linked Lists
- LLs consume > 2x more memory - as the pointers are 8 bytes.
- LLs do not allow indexing. Cannot do binary search.
- Self referencing structs need to be defined with the type name e.g.,
```
typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *next;
}
node;
```
- `n1->number = 1;` is syntactic sugar for `(*n).number = 1;`.
- The program only needs to remember the location of the first (head) node. All operations on the linked list must begin from the head node (node *list).


## Week 6 - Lecture 6 - Python
### General Knowledge
- No parentheses or braces, code is structured using indentation.
- No array data type in the strict sense of contiguous block of memory. Replaced by list `nums = [1,2,3]`.
- No risk of overflowing integers as in C as python automatically assigns 8 bytes to all integer values.
- No concept of a single character, chars are just strings of length 1.
- `range(start, stop, step=1)` function hands an integer between start and stop 1 at a time.

### Positional & Named Arguments
- In Python the `print` function accepts not only positional arguments e.g., `print("hello ", "parik", " panchal")`, but also accepts named arguments such as `end`.

### Slices
- Python supports slicing lists e.g., `nums[index_inclusive:index_exclusive]` which returns a copy of the list but only with the values between the range of indexes.
- The `return 0;` in C is replaced by `sys.exit(0)` - this can be check from the terminal by running `echo $?`.
- Hash-tables (key value pairs) and Hash-sets (values only) are built into Python as `dict()` and `set()` respectively.


### Common functions
- Return type of `input()` is
